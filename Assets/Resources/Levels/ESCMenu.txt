The Grid#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_03#The DoE uses a grid system for its cyber security. The Hacker can connect to any object as long as it is on the grid. Place additional transmitters on the ground to expose more of the grid for the Hacker.#1#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01
Doors#Textures/ESCMenu/Big_Tdoors#Doors block your progress from room to room. You can tell whether or not you are able to pass through a door by the color of the symbol in the middle of the door. If the door symbol is red, ask the Hacker to connect to the door to let you through. Drones are able to pass through any door, red or green. If you are being chased by a guard, ask the Hacker to secure-lock a door to keep drones out. #1#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01
Drones#Textures/ESCMenu/Big_Tdrones#Drones patrol the DoE in search of intruders. While a drone has locked on to your position, it will increase the speed that lockdown occurs.#1#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01
Jammers#Textures/ESCMenu/Big_Tjammers#Blocks hacker from connecting nodes around its radius. Thief has to locate and disable it.#1#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01
SAPs#Textures/ESCMenu/Big_TSAPs#Security Access panels can be used by the thief to reduce the threat meter.#1#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01
Transmitter#Textures/ESCMenu/Big_Ttransmitter#Used by thief to give access to nodes for hacker.#1#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01
Security Terminal#Textures/ESCMenu/Big_TSecurityTerminal#After the hacker captures it, the security terminal will display a password. This password can be used at various security access nodes by hacker to gain security clearance to other areas of the map.#1#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01
Override Switch#Textures/ESCMenu/Big_TOverrideSwitch#Will appear on the map during lockdown. Use it to stop lockdown.#1#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01
Ping System#Textures/ESCMenu/Big_TPingSystem#The hacker can ping areas on the map to the thief. It will appear as green hexes on the thief's world and can be seen through walls. Tip :- The hacker can ping paths to the thief.#1#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01
Lockdown Indicator#Textures/ESCMenu/Big_LockdownIndicator#Shows threat meter. If full, the level enters lockdown mode. Work with the hacker to locate and activate the override switch.#1#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01
Source Node#Textures/ESCMenu/Big_SourceNode#All the power on the Hacker's grid comes from the Source Node. By drawing an unbroken chain of links, the Hacker will be able to access any of the other door nodes on the map to help the Thief.#2#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01
Link#Textures/ESCMenu/Big_Link#Links are used by the Hacker to transfer power from the Source Node to other nodes on the Hacker's map. Links that are directly connected to the source node will glow blue, and allow access to any other node that they touch. Nodes that are not connected to the Source Node will stay white, and need to be connected to transmit power to other areas of the map.#2#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01
Radar Node#Textures/ESCMenu/Big_RadarNode#If the Hacker powers a Radar Node, guards from the Thief's world will show up within the Radar's range. If guards ever travel outside this range, they won't show up on your screen. #2#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01
Security Terminal#Textures/ESCMenu/Big_SecurityTerminal#When the Hacker surrounds the Security Terminal with powered links, a password will be displayed in the Theif's world. When the Hacker and the Thief work together, they can obtain a password for the password node to get higher security.#2#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01
Password Node#Textures/ESCMenu/Big_PasswordNode#Once a Security Terminal reveals the password to the Thief, the Hacker can enter that password in to the Password Node. A successfully entered password will unlock other nodes in the facility.#2#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_02#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01
Door Node#Textures/ESCMenu/Big_DoorNode#Displays doors on the map. Connect to the door to unlock it. Toggle door open/close by clicking on it.#2#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_03#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01

Tracers#Textures/ESCMenu/Big_Tracers#Hacker's main enemy! Avoid tracers. Any node tree in the tracers path will be destroyed if powered.#2#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01
Transmitters#Textures/ESCMenu/Big_Transmitters#Gives acces to different areas of the grid to the hacker. Transmitted are placed on the level by the thief.#2#Textures/Loading_Screen#Textures/StartScreenUI/LevelThumb_Prelude_01
